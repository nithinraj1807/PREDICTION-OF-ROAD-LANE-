# PREDICTION-OF-ROAD-LANE-
This project implements a real-time lane detection system that processes video input to identify and highlight lane boundaries on roads.  It also distinguishes between left and right lanes and identifies their types (solid or dashed) based on pixel density.
Using computer vision techniques such as Canny edge detection, Gaussian blurring, region masking, and Hough Line Transform, the system detects and overlays solid and dashed lane markings on each video frame.
The solution is designed to provide a robust base for autonomous vehicle systems, driver-assistance technologies, and advanced visual navigation modules.
